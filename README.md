Feather
====================

Feather is a simple and easy WordPress starter theme based on Bootstrap3 and adhearing as closely as possible to the "WordPress Way". Basically, no wrappers, no rewriting, no advanced configurations, and it's not all that DRY. 

You'll see familiar template files, sidebars, index, page, front-page.php theme files. Etc.. It comes with a couple menus, widget areas, etc..

This is meant for hacking away at. Don't bother creating a child theme for it. Once you grab it, don't feel compelled to update it. It uses enough WordPress functionality that we're essentially outsourcing backwards compatibility to WordPress, which they have taken pretty seriously.

This means this thing should last you a good long while.

It makes use of plugins mentioned below. These can be activated to enhance functionality, but are not required.

Makes heavy use of theme files and functions found in Roots theme and Underscores theme.
