Feather
====================

Feather is a WordPress starter theme based on Bootstrap and influenced by Roots and Underscores. Feather is simple and easy to use and employs the simplest implementations of Twitter's Bootstrap3, WordPress Codex, and libraries from the popular WordPress starter themes Roots and Underscores.

This is very near to a WordPress skeleton theme. There are no wrappers, no rewriting, no advanced configurations, no init scripts, and it's not all that DRY.  You'll see familiar template files such as index, single, archive, and page, sidebars, a few widgets/sidebars, and a couple menus.

This is meant for hacking away at. Don't bother creating a child theme for it. Once you grab it, don't feel compelled to update it. It uses enough WordPress functionality that we're essentially outsourcing backwards compatibility to WordPress, which they have taken pretty seriously. This means this thing should last you a good long while.

This starter theme optionally employes a number of popular and well regarded plugins to enhance functionality. A list of these plugins can be found below. These can be activated to enhance functionality, but are not required.
